# example-dependency

This is a sample Git submodule designed for use in demonstrating and testing GitHub Actions workflows that integrate with submodules. Its primary purpose is to be included in a larger "parent" repository where its integration can be verified through CI/CD.

## Purpose

This submodule is intended to:

*   Serve as a simple, self-contained dependency for a larger project.
*   Provide a predictable and easily modifiable codebase for testing submodule-related workflows.
*   Demonstrate how changes in a submodule can trigger and be validated by workflows in the parent repository.
